# Delegator2 Smart Contract

The `delegator2` smart contract is our showcase for executing other smart contracts on-chain.
The difference with the initial `delegator` contract is that now the other contracts 
(`accumulator`, `adder` and `subber`) are already instantiated (initially they were only uploaded).
